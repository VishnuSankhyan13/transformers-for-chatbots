The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model\n",

In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,.,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,.,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,.,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\u001b[00m\n"

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model\n",

In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,.,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,.,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,.,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\u001b[00m\n"

      "the ﬁrst transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence- aligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,.,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,.,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,.,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",
      "\n",
      "a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2 Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions.

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\u001b[00m\n"

In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,.,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,.,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,.,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",

      "a few cases [22], however, such attention mechanisms are used in conjunction with a recurrent network. In this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead relying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output. The Transformer allows for signiﬁcantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in translation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs. 2 Background The goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU [20], ByteNet [15] and ConvS2S [8], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building block, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models, the number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows in the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This\n",

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\u001b[00m\n"

In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,.,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,.,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,.,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",

The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model\n",

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\u001b[00m\n"

In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate self-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [14, 15] and [8]. 3 Model Architecture Most competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 29]. Here, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1,.,x n) to a sequence of continuous representations z = (z1,.,z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output sequence (y1,.,y m) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive [9], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next. The Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\n",

Gomez∗† University of Toronto aidan@cs.toronto.edu Łukasz Kaiser ∗ Google Brain lukaszkaiser@google.com Illia Polosukhin∗‡ illia.polosukhin@gmail.com Abstract The dominant sequence transduction models are based on complex recurrent or convolutional neural networks that include an encoder and a decoder. The best performing models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention mechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer, based solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions entirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to be superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring signiﬁcantly less time to train. Our model\n",

      "makes it more difﬁcult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 11]. In the Transformer this is reduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as described in section 3.2. Self-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been used successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization, textual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 22, 23, 19]. End-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence- aligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and language modeling tasks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is\u001b[00m\n"

Table 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model architectures from the literature. We estimate the number of ﬂoating point operations used to train a model by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained single-precision ﬂoating-point capacity of each GPU 5. 6.2 Model Variations To evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model in different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the development set, newstest2013.

On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.0 after training for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the best models from the literature. 1 Introduction Recurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [12] and gated recurrent [7] neural networks in particular, have been ﬁrmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and transduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 29, 2, 5]. Numerous efforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder architectures [31, 21, 13]. ∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random.

They employ various machine learning approaches, both generative and non-generative, to address text-related challenges such as classification, summarization, sequence-to-sequence tasks, and controlled text generation. Organizations can opt for third-party APIs, but fine-tuning models with proprietary data offers domain-specific and pertinent results, enabling cost-effective and independent solutions deployable across different environments in a secure manner.\n",
      "Ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness is crucial when choosing a strategy for fine-tuning. This blog explores arguably the most popular and effective variant of such parameter efficient methods, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), with a particular emphasis on QLoRA (an even more efficient variant of LoRA). The approach here will be to take an open large language model and fine-tune it to generate fictitious product descriptions when prompted with a product name and a category. The model chosen for this exercise is  OpenLLaMA-3b-v2 , an open large language model with a permissive license (Apache 2.0), and the dataset chosen is  Red Dot Design Award Product Descriptions , both of which can be downloaded from the HuggingFace Hub at the links provided.\n",
      "Fine-Tuning, LoRA and QLoRA\n",
      "In the realm of language models, fine tuning an existing language model to perform a specific task on specific data is a common practice. This involves adding a task-specific head, if necessary, and updating the weights of the neural network through backpropagation during the training process. It is important to note the distinction between this finetuning process and training from scratch. In the latter scenario, the model's weights are randomly initialized, while in finetuning, the weights are already optimized to a certain extent during the pre-training phase. The decision of which weights to optimize or update, and which ones to keep frozen, depends on the chosen technique.\n",
      "Full finetuning involves optimizing or training all layers of the neural network. While this approach typically yields the best results, it is also the most resource-intensive and time-consuming.\n",
      "Fortunately, there exist parameter-efficient approaches for fine-tuning that have proven to be effective. Although most such approaches have yielded less performance, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) has bucked this trend by even outperforming full finetuning in some cases, as a consequence of avoiding catastrophic forgetting (a phenomenon which occurs when the knowledge of the pretrained model is lost during the fine-tuning process).\n",
      "LoRA  is an improved finetuning method where instead of finetuning all the weights that constitute the weight matrix of the pre-trained large language model, two smaller matrices that approximate this larger matrix are fine-tuned. These matrices constitute the LoRA adapter. This fine-tuned adapter is then loaded to the pretrained model and used for inference.\n",
      "QLoRA  is an even more memory efficient version of LoRA where the pretrained model is loaded to GPU memory as quantized 4-bit weights (compared to 8-bits in the case of LoRA), while preserving similar effectiveness to LoRA. Probing this method, comparing the two methods when necessary, and figuring out the best combination of QLoRA hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance with the quickest training time will be the focus here.\n",
      "LoRA is implemented in the Hugging Face Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library, offering ease of use and QLoRA can be leveraged by using  bitsandbytes  and  PEFT  together. HuggingFace  Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL)  library offers a convenient trainer for supervised finetuning with seamless integration for LoRA. These three libraries will provide the necessary tools to finetune the chosen pretrained model to generate coherent and convincing product descriptions once prompted with an instruction indicating the desired attributes.\n",
      "Prepping the data for supervised fine-tuning\n",
      "To probe the effectiveness of QLoRA for fine tuning a model for instruction following, it is essential to transform the data to a format suited for supervised fine-tuning. Supervised fine-tuning in essence, further trains a pretrained model to generate text conditioned on a provided prompt. It is supervised in that the model is finetuned on a dataset that has prompt-response pairs formatted in a consistent manner.\n",
      "An example observation from our chosen dataset from the Hugging Face hub looks as follows:\n",
      "product\n",
      "category\n",
      "description\n",
      "text\n",
      "\"Biamp Rack Products\"\n",
      "\"Digital Audio Processors\"\n",
      "\"“High recognition value, uniform aesthetics and practical scalability – this has been impressively achieved with the Biamp brand language …\"\n",
      "\"Product Name: Biamp Rack Products; Product Category: Digital Audio Processors; Product Description: “High recognition value, uniform aesthetics and practical scalability – this has been impressively achieved with the Biamp brand language …\n",
      "As useful as this dataset is, this is not well formatted for fine-tuning of a language model for instruction following in the manner described above.\n",
      "The following code snippet loads the dataset from the Hugging Face hub into memory, transforms the necessary fields into a consistently formatted string representing the prompt, and inserts the response( i.e. the description), immediately afterwards. This format is known as the ‘Alpaca format’ in large language model research circles as it was the format used to finetune the original LlaMA model from Meta to result in the Alpaca model, one of the first widely distributed instruction-following large language models (although not licensed for commercial use).\n",
      "The resulting prompts are then loaded into a hugging face dataset for supervised finetuning. Each such prompt has the following format.\n",
      "To facilitate quick experimentation, each fine-tuning exercise will be done on a 5000 observation subset of this data.\n",
      "Testing model performance before fine-tuning\n",
      "Before any fine-tuning, it’s a good idea to check how the model performs without any fine-tuning to get a baseline for pre-trained model performance.\n",
      "The model can be loaded in 8-bit as follows and prompted with the format specified in the  model card on Hugging Face .\n",
      "The output obtained is not quite what we want.\n",
      "The first part of the result is actually satisfactory, but the rest of it is more of a rambling mess.\n",
      "Similarly, if the model is prompted with the input text in the ‘Alpaca format’ as discussed before, the output is expected to be just as sub-optimal:\n",
      "And sure enough, it is:\n",
      "The model performs what it was trained to do, predicts the next most probable token. The point of supervised fine-tuning in this context is to generate the desired text in a controllable manner. Please note that in the subsequent experiments, while QLoRA leverages a model loaded in 4-bit with the weights frozen, the inference process to examine output quality is done once the model has been loaded in 8-bit as shown above for consistency.\n",
      "The Turnable Knobs\n",
      "When using PEFT to train a model with LoRA or QLoRA (note that, as mentioned before, the primary difference between the two is that in the latter, the pretrained models are frozen in 4-bit during the fine-tuning process), the hyperparameters of the low rank adaptation process can be defined in a LoRA config as shown below:\n",
      "Two of these hyperparameters, r and target_modules are empirically shown to affect adaptation quality significantly and will be the focus of the tests that follow. The other hyperparameters are kept constant at the values indicated above for simplicity.\n",
      "r  represents the rank of the low rank matrices learned during the finetuning process. As this value is increased, the number of parameters needed to be updated during the low-rank adaptation increases. Intuitively, a lower r may lead to a quicker, less computationally intensive training process, but may affect the quality of the model thus produced. However, increasing r beyond a certain value may not yield any discernible increase in quality of model output. How the value of r affects adaptation (fine-tuning) quality will be put to the test shortly.\n",
      "When fine-tuning with LoRA, it is possible to target specific modules in the model architecture. The adaptation process will target these modules and apply the update matrices to them. Similar to the situation with \" r ,\" targeting more modules during LoRA adaptation results in increased training time and greater demand for compute resources. Thus, it is a common practice to only target the attention blocks of the transformer. However, recent work as shown in the  QLoRA paper  by Dettmers et al. suggests that targeting all linear layers results in better adaptation quality. This will be explored here as well.\n",
      "Names of the linear layers of the model can be conveniently appended to a list with the following code snippet:\n",
      "Tuning the finetuning with LoRA\n",
      "The developer experience of fine tuning large language models in general have improved dramatically over the past year or so. The latest high level abstraction from Hugging Face is the SFTTrainer class in the TRL library. To perform QLoRA, all that is needed is the following:\n",
      "1.  Load the model to GPU memory in 4-bit (bitsandbytes enables this process).\n",
      "2.  Define the LoRA configuration as discussed above.\n",
      "3.  Define the train and test splits of the prepped instruction following data into Hugging Face Dataset objects.\n",
      "4. Define training arguments. These include the number of epochs, batch size and other training hyperparameters which will be kept constant during this exercise.\n",
      "5. Pass these arguments into an instance of SFTTrainer.\n",
      "These steps are clearly indicated in the source file in the  repository  associated with this blog.\n",
      "The actual training logic is abstracted away nicely as follows:\n",
      "If MLFlow autologging is enabled in the Databricks workspace, which is highly recommended, all the training parameters and metrics are automatically tracked and logged with the MLFlow tracking server. This functionality is invaluable in monitoring long-running training tasks. Needless to say, the fine-tuning process is performed using a compute cluster (in this case, a single node with a single A100 GPU) created using the latest Databricks Machine runtime with GPU support.\n",
      "Hyperparameter Combination #1: QLoRA with r=8 and targeting “q_proj”, “v_proj”\n",
      "The first combination of QLoRA hyperparameters attempted is r=8 and targets only the attention blocks, namely “q_proj” and “v_proj” for adaptation.\n",
      "The following code snippets gives the number of trainable parameters:\n",
      "These choices result in 2,662,400 parameters being updated during the fine-tuning process (~2.6 million) from a total of ~3.2 billion parameters the model consists of. This is less than 0.1% of the model parameters. The entire finetuning process on a single Nvidia A100 with 80 GBs of GPU for 3 epochs only takes roughly 12 minutes. The GPU utilization metrics can be conveniently viewed at the metrics tab of the cluster configurations.\n",
      "At the end of the training process, the fine-tuned model is obtained by loading the adapter weights to the pre-trained model as follows:\n",
      "This model can now be used for inference as any other model.\n",
      "Qualitative Evaluation\n",
      "A couple of example prompt-response pairs are listed below\n",
      "Prompt (passed to the model in the Alpaca format, not shown for conciseness here):\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Corelogic Smooth Mouse, belonging to category: Optical Mouse\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Hoover Lightspeed, belonging to category: Cordless Vacuum Cleaner\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "The model has clearly been adapted for generating more consistent descriptions. However the response to the first prompt about the optical mouse is quite short and the following phrase \u0000\u0000“ The vacuum cleaner is equipped with a dust container that can be emptied via a dust container ” is logically flawed.\n",
      "Hyperparameter Combination #2: QLoRA with r=16 and targeting all linear layers\n",
      "Surely, things can be improved here. It is worth exploring increasing the rank of low rank matrices learned during adaptation to 16, i.e. double the value of r to 16 and keep all else  the same. This doubles the number of trainable parameters to 5,324,800 (~5.3 million).\n",
      "Qualitative Evaluation\n",
      "The quality of output, however, remains unchanged for the same exact prompts.\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Corelogic Smooth Mouse, belonging to category: Optical Mouse\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Hoover Lightspeed, belonging to category: Cordless Vacuum Cleaner\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "The same lack of detail and logical flaws in detail where details are available persists. If this fine tuned model is used for product description generation in a real-world scenario, this is not acceptable output.\n",
      "Hyperparameter Combination #3: QLoRA with r=8 and targeting all linear layers\n",
      "Given that doubling r does not seemingly result in any perceivable increase in output quality, it is worth changing the other important knob. i.e. targeting all linear layers instead of just the attention blocks. Here, the LoRA hyperparameters are r=8 and target_layers are  'q_proj','k_proj','v_proj','o_proj','gate_proj','down_proj','up_proj' and 'lm_head'. This increases the number of parameters updated to 12,994,560 and increases the training time to roughly 15.5 minutes.\n",
      "Qualitative Evaluation\n",
      "Prompting the model with the same prompts yield the following:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Corelogic Smooth Mouse, belonging to category: Optical Mouse\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Hoover Lightspeed, belonging to category: Cordless Vacuum Cleaner\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Now it is possible to see a somewhat longer coherent description of the fictitious optical mouse and there are no logical flaws in the description of the vacuum cleaner. The product descriptions are not only logical, but relevant. Just as a reminder, these relatively high-quality results are obtained by fine-tuning less than a 1% of the model’s weights with a total dataset of 5000 such prompt-description pairs formatted in a consistent manner.\n",
      "Hyperparameter Combination #4: LoRA with  r=8 and targeting all linear transformer layers\n",
      "It is also worth exploring whether the quality of output from the model improves if the pretrained model is frozen in 8-bit instead of 4-bit. In other words, replicating the exact finetuning process using LoRA instead of QLoRA. Here, the LoRA hyperparameters are kept the same as before, in the new-found optimal configuration, i.e. r=8 and targeting all linear transformer layers during the adaptation process.\n",
      "Qualitative Evaluation\n",
      "The results for the two prompts used throughout the article are as given below:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Corelogic Smooth Mouse, belonging to category: Optical Mouse\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Prompt:\n",
      "Create a detailed description for the following product: Hoover Lightspeed, belonging to category: Cordless Vacuum Cleaner\n",
      "Response:\n",
      "Again, there isn’t much of an improvement in the quality of the output text.\n",
      "Key Observations\n",
      "Based on the above set of trials, and further evidence detailed in the excellent publication presenting QLoRA, it can be deduced that the value of r (the rank of matrices updated during adaptation) does not improve adaptation quality beyond a certain point. The biggest improvement is observed in targeting all linear layers in the adaptation process, as opposed to just the attention blocks, as commonly documented in technical literature detailing LoRA and QLoRA. The trials executed above and other empirical evidence suggest that QLoRA does not indeed suffer from any discernible reduction in quality of text generated, compared to LoRA.\n",
      "Further Considerations for using LoRA adapters in deployment\n",
      "It's important to optimize the usage of adapters and understand the limitations of the technique. The size of the LoRA adapter obtained through finetuning is typically just a few megabytes, while the pretrained base model can be several gigabytes in memory and on disk. During inference, both the adapter and the pretrained LLM need to be loaded, so the memory requirement remains similar.\n",
      "Furthermore, if the weights of the pre-trained LLM and the adapter aren’t merged, there will be a slight increase in inference latency. Fortunately, with the PEFT library, the process of merging the weights with the adapter can be done with a single line of code as shown here:\n",
      "The figure below outlines the process from fine-tuning an adapter to model deployment.\n",
      "While the adapter pattern offers significant benefits, merging adapters is not a universal solution. One advantage of the adapter pattern is the ability to deploy a single large pretrained model with task-specific adapters. This allows for efficient inference by utilizing the pretrained model as a backbone for different tasks. However, merging weights makes this approach impossible. The decision to merge weights depends on the specific use case and acceptable inference latency. Nonetheless, LoRA/ QLoRA continues to be a highly effective method for parameter efficient fine-tuning and is widely used.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Low Rank Adaptation is a powerful fine-tuning technique that can yield great results if used with the right configuration. Choosing the correct value of rank and the layers of the neural network architecture to target during adaptation could decide the quality of the output from the fine-tuned model. QLoRA results in further memory savings while preserving the adaptation quality. Even when the fine-tuning is performed,  there are several important engineering considerations to ensure the adapted model is deployed in the correct manner.\n",
      "In summary, a concise table indicating the different combinations of LoRA parameters attempted, text quality output and number of parameters updated when fine-tuning OpenLLaMA-3b-v2 for 3 epochs on 5000 observations on a single A100 is shown below.\n",

      "Efficient Fine-Tuning with LoRA: A Guide to Optimal Parameter Selection for Large Language Models\n",
      "Published: August 30, 2023\n",
      "\n",
      "With the rapid advancement of neural network-based techniques and Large Language Model (LLM) research, businesses are increasingly interested in AI applications for value generation. They employ various machine learning approaches, both generative and non-generative, to address text-related challenges such as classification, summarization, sequence-to-sequence tasks, and controlled text generation. Organizations can opt for third-party APIs, but fine-tuning models with proprietary data offers domain-specific and pertinent results, enabling cost-effective and independent solutions deployable across different environments in a secure manner.\n",
      "\n",
      "Ensuring efficient resource utilization and cost-effectiveness is crucial when choosing a strategy for fine-tuning. This blog explores arguably the most popular and effective variant of such parameter efficient methods, Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA), with a particular emphasis on QLoRA (an even more efficient variant of LoRA). The approach here will be to take an open large language model and fine-tune it to generate fictitious product descriptions when prompted with a product name and a category. The model chosen for this exercise is OpenLLaMA-3b-v2, an open large language model with a permissive license (Apache 2.0), and the dataset chosen is Red Dot Design Award Product Descriptions.\n",
      "\n",
      "Fine-Tuning, LoRA, and QLoRA:\n",
      "In the realm of language models, fine-tuning an existing language model to perform a specific task on specific data is a common practice. This involves adding a task-specific head, if necessary, and updating the weights of the neural network through backpropagation during the training process. It is important to note the distinction between this fine-tuning process and training from scratch. In the latter scenario, the model's weights are randomly initialized, while in fine-tuning, the weights are already optimized to a certain extent during the pre-training phase. The decision of which weights to optimize or update, and which ones to keep frozen, depends on the chosen technique.\n",
      "\n",
      "LoRA is an improved fine-tuning method where instead of fine-tuning all the weights that constitute the weight matrix of the pre-trained large language model, two smaller matrices that approximate this larger matrix are fine-tuned. These matrices constitute the LoRA adapter. This fine-tuned adapter is then loaded to the pretrained model and used for inference.\n",
      "\n",
      "QLoRA is an even more memory-efficient version of LoRA where the pretrained model is loaded to GPU memory as quantized 4-bit weights (compared to 8-bits in the case of LoRA), while preserving similar effectiveness to LoRA. Probing this method, comparing the two methods when necessary, and figuring out the best combination of QLoRA hyperparameters to achieve optimal performance with the quickest training time will be the focus here.\n",
      "\n",
      "LoRA is implemented in the Hugging Face Parameter Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) library, offering ease of use, and QLoRA can be leveraged by using bitsandbytes and PEFT together. HuggingFace Transformer Reinforcement Learning (TRL) library offers a convenient trainer for supervised fine-tuning with seamless integration for LoRA. These three libraries will provide the necessary tools to fine-tune the chosen pretrained model to generate coherent and convincing product descriptions once prompted with an instruction indicating the desired attributes.\u001b[00m\n",

We plan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and to investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efﬁciently handle large inputs and outputs such as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours. The code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https:/github.com/ tensorflow/tensor2tensor.

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\n",

      "is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility function than dot product may be beneﬁcial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected, bigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-ﬁtting. In row (E) we replace our sinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [8], and observe nearly identical results to the base model. 7 Conclusion In this work, we presented the Transformer, the ﬁrst sequence transduction model based entirely on attention, replacing the recurrent layers most commonly used in encoder-decoder architectures with multi-headed self-attention. For translation tasks, the Transformer can be trained signiﬁcantly faster than architectures based on recurrent or convolutional layers. On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014 English-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best model outperforms even all previously reported ensembles. We are excited about the\u001b[00m\n"

By integrating an information retrieval system, RAG allows models to access external knowledge bases, enhancing their ability to generate contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. This section delves into the mechanics of RAG and its implications for Transformer architectures.\n",
      "Core Mechanism of RAG\n",
      "At its core, RAG operates by retrieving relevant text passages from a local knowledge database based on user input. This process can be broken down into several key components:\n",
      "Input Sequence (x) : The user’s query or input that initiates the retrieval process.\n",
      "Retriever (p_n(z|x)) : A model component that identifies and fetches the top-k relevant text passages (z) from the database in response to the input sequence.\n",
      "Output Sequence (y) : The final generated text that incorporates both the input and the retrieved passages, represented as y = f(x, z).\n",
      "This architecture allows RAG to leverage both the global knowledge inherent in LLMs and the specific, localized knowledge stored in databases, creating a hybrid model that is more versatile and informative.\n",
      "Advantages of RAG in Transformer Models\n",
      "The integration of RAG into Transformer models offers several advantages:\n",
      "Enhanced Reasoning : RAG enables models to reason about new data without the need for extensive retraining or gradient descent optimization. This is particularly beneficial in dynamic fields where information changes rapidly.\n",
      "Easier Updates : Updating the knowledge base becomes straightforward, allowing for real-time incorporation of new information without the need to retrain the entire model.\n",
      "Source Attribution : RAG facilitates better transparency in generated content by allowing models to cite sources, thereby reducing the incidence of hallucinations—instances where the model generates incorrect or fabricated information.\n",
      "Reduced Parameter Count : By offloading some of the knowledge retrieval tasks to an external system, RAG can reduce the parameter count required for reasoning, making models more efficient and cost-effective.\n",
      "Latest Breakthroughs in 2024\n",
      "As of 2024, the latest breakthroughs in Transformer models have further refined the RAG approach. Researchers are exploring more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms that enhance the relevance and accuracy of the retrieved information. For instance, advancements in sparse attention mechanisms have shown promise in improving the efficiency of RAG systems, allowing them to handle larger datasets without compromising performance.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "In summary, RAG significantly impacts the functionality of Transformer models by merging retrieval capabilities with generative processes. This hybrid approach not only enhances the models' reasoning abilities but also ensures that they remain relevant and accurate in an ever-evolving information landscape.

The latest breakthroughs in transformer models are set to enhance the capabilities of Generative Pretrained Transformers (GPT), making them more efficient and versatile in various applications.\n",
      "Enhanced Model Architectures\n",
      "Recent developments have introduced new architectures that improve the performance of GPT models. These enhancements include:\n",
      "Sparse Attention Mechanisms : Allowing models to focus on relevant parts of the input data, reducing computational load and improving response times.\n",
      "Multi-Modal Capabilities : Integrating text, image, and audio processing within a single model, enabling richer interactions and outputs.\n",

      "Self-Supervised Learning : Leveraging vast amounts of unlabelled data to improve model understanding and generation capabilities.\n",
      "Continual Learning : Allowing models to adapt and learn from new data without forgetting previous knowledge, enhancing their relevance and accuracy over time.\n",
      "Applications in Various Domains\n",
      "The applications of GPT models are expanding beyond traditional text generation:\n",
      "Creative Industries : Tools like DALL-E and Midjourney are revolutionizing art and design, enabling artists to generate unique visuals based on textual descriptions.\n",
      "Software Development : GitHub Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s Codex, exemplifies how GPT models can assist developers by suggesting code snippets and automating repetitive tasks, significantly increasing productivity.\n",
      "Ethical Considerations\n",
      "As the capabilities of GPT models grow, so do the ethical implications:\n",
      "Bias Mitigation : Ongoing research aims to reduce biases in model outputs, ensuring fair and equitable use across diverse applications.\n",

      "In summary, the advancements in Generative Pretrained Transformers for 2024 promise to reshape various sectors, driving innovation while also necessitating careful consideration of ethical implications.\n",
      "Impact of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) on Transformer Models Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) represents a significant advancement in the capabilities of Transformer models, particularly in the context of large language models (LLMs). By integrating an information retrieval system, RAG allows models to access external knowledge bases, enhancing their ability to generate contextually relevant and up-to-date responses. This section delves into the mechanics of RAG and its implications for Transformer architectures.\n",
      "Core Mechanism of RAG\n",
      "At its core, RAG operates by retrieving relevant text passages from a local knowledge database based on user input. This process can be broken down into several key components:\n",
      "Input Sequence (x) : The user’s query or input that initiates the retrieval process.\n",
      "Retriever (p_n(z|x)) : A model component that identifies and fetches the top-k relevant text passages (z) from the database in response to the input sequence.\n",
      "Output Sequence (y) : The final generated text that incorporates both the input and the retrieved passages, represented as y = f(x, z).\n",
      "This architecture allows RAG to leverage both the global knowledge inherent in LLMs and the specific, localized knowledge stored in databases, creating a hybrid model that is more versatile and informative.\n",
      "Advantages of RAG in Transformer Models\n",
      "The integration of RAG into Transformer models offers several advantages:\n",
      "Enhanced Reasoning : RAG enables models to reason about new data without the need for extensive retraining or gradient descent optimization. This is particularly beneficial in dynamic fields where information changes rapidly.\n",
      "Easier Updates : Updating the knowledge base becomes straightforward, allowing for real-time incorporation of new information without the need to retrain the entire model.\n",
      "Source Attribution : RAG facilitates better transparency in generated content by allowing models to cite sources, thereby reducing the incidence of hallucinations—instances where the model generates incorrect or fabricated information.\n",
      "Reduced Parameter Count : By offloading some of the knowledge retrieval tasks to an external system, RAG can reduce the parameter count required for reasoning, making models more efficient and cost-effective.\n",
      "Latest Breakthroughs in 2024\n",
      "As of 2024, the latest breakthroughs in Transformer models have further refined the RAG approach. Researchers are exploring more sophisticated retrieval mechanisms that enhance the relevance and accuracy of\u001b[00m\n",

We employ a residual connection [10] around each of the two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is LayerNorm(x+ Sublayer(x), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer itself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding layers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512. Decoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6identical layers. In addition to the two sub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections around each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention sub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This masking, combined\n",

      "Introduction\n",
      "The other day, I was reading “ Natural Language Processing with Transformers ” a book authored by Lewis Tunstall, Leandro von Werra, and Thomas Wolf. In it, I came across Scaling laws and challenges associated with scaling Transformer models. This topic also included excerpts from Richard Sutton’s startling essay titled “The Bitter Lesson,” which suggested that embedding/relying on a human-knowledge approach can complicate things, making them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation. The mention of embedding human knowledge¬†piqued my interest to delve deeper into the matter. It reminded me of a conversation I had with a respectable AI Researcher on Twitter earlier this year.\n",
      "¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† ¬† Source: Canva\n",
      "In this post, we will be exploring:\n",
      "What are the potential drawbacks of embedding human knowledge of the domain directly into the models than leveraging the computation?\n",
      "Why is scaling required?\n",
      "What are scaling laws?\n",
      "What are the Challenges with scaling transformers?\n",
      "Now let’s dive in!\n",
      "Drawbacks of encoding human knowledge directly into the model\n",
      "Following are the potential drawbacks of embedding human knowledge directly into the model than leveraging the computation:\n",
      "1) Leveraging human knowledge leads to quicker gain. Still, in the long run, methods leveraging computation outperform:¬† ¬† In 2019, the researcher Richard Sutton published a startling essay titled “ The Bitter Lesson , “ in which he stated general methods that leverage computation are the most effective, and by a large margin. Leveraging human knowledge of the domain can offer quick gains in the short term. However, leveraging the computation can outperform the former in the long run.¬† Furthermore, the human-knowledge approach often complicates methods, making them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation.\n",
      "In games like chess or Go,¬†the concept of encoding human knowledge within AI systems was eventually outdone by greater computation. ¬† Sutton refers to this as the “bitter lesson” for the AI research community. There are signs that a similar lesson is at play with transformers. At the same time, many early BERT and GPT descendants focused on tweaking the architecture or pretraining objectives. The best-performing models like GPT-3 are basically scaled-up versions of the original models without many architectural modifications.\n",
      "2) Human biases: If we decide on encoding the human knowledge directly into the model, we might also be encoding our biases. Biases could be inflicted from a person’s experience/knowledge and discretion. So, data curation is a highly subjective and sensitive matter. Furthermore, even the entire ML pipeline can be biased as well. However, utilizing a massive data pool gives us a semblance of being more unbiased than hardwiring human knowledge directly.\n",
      "3). Exploration Vs. Exploitation: While studying Reinforcement Learning, I came across this concept that resonated with me. Although we are talking about the Transformers specifically, this concept can also be applied here. While exploiting our existing knowledge can provide us the semblance of quick gains, exploration by leveraging vast datasets and scaling the model could lead to long-term benefits and help us explore the unexplored.\n",
      "4). Is our existing understanding of various domains absolutely correct? : The dilemma is, is our existing knowledge perfect enough that we can solely rely on that and avoid further exploration? Often, even scientists do not conclude and claim something as “absolute truth.” They often cite the results saying something like, based on these (limited set of) observations. It appears to be […….]. Furthermore, the scientific community may hold opposing views based on their different experiment outcomes and limited observations.\n",
      "Why is Scaling required?\n",
      "Empirical evidence suggests that large language models perform better on downstream tasks, and capabilities such as zero-shot and few-shot learning emerge in the 10 to 100 B parameter range. However, the number of parameters is not the only key factor affecting the model’s performance. The performance of language models seems to obey a power law relationship with model size and other factors. Hence, the amount o f computing and training data need to be scaled in tandem to train these models.\n",
      "In fig. 1, we can see a timeline of the development of the largest models since the release of the original Transformer architecture in 2017,¬† illustrating that model size has increased by over four orders of magnitude in just a few years!\n",
      "Fig. 1 Parameter counts over time for prominent Transformer architectures\n",

      "Scaling Laws\n",
      "Scaling laws allow empirically quantifying the ‚Äúbigger is better‚Äù paradigm for language models by studying their behavior with varying compute budgets C , dataset size D , and model size N .¬†The key idea is to plot the dependence of the cross-entropy loss L on these three factors and see if a relationship emerges. For autoregressive models like those in the GPT family, the resulting loss curves are shown in Fig. 2, where each blue curve represents the training run of a single model.\n",
      "Fig. 2 a) Power-law scaling of test loss Vs. Compute b) Dataset size c) Parameters\n",
      "(Source: https://bit.ly/3Ovuvdy)\n",
      "We can infer a few things from these loss curves:\n",
      "1. The relationship between performance and scale:¬† Although hyperparameter optimization is typically emphasized to improve performance on a fixed set of datasets, scaling laws suggest a more productive path toward better models is to focus on increasing N , C , and D in tandem.\n",
      "2. Smooth Power Laws: The test loss L has a power law relationship with each of N , C , and D across several orders of magnitude (power law relationships are linear on a log-log scale). These power-law relationships can be expressed as follows:\n",
      "where, : scaling exponent\n",
      "Typical values lie in the 0.05‚Äì0.095 range, and one salient feature of these power laws is that the early part of a loss curve can be extrapolated to predict the approximate loss if the training was conducted for much longer.\n",
      "3. Sample efficiency:¬† Large models can achieve the same performance as smaller models with fewer training steps. The loss curve plateaus over some training steps, indicating that one gets diminishing returns in performance compared to simply scaling up the model. Fig. 3 illustrates the scaling laws for modalities like Images, videos, mathematical problem solving, language, etc.\n",
      "Fig. 3 Power-law scaling of test loss Vs. compute budget for different modalities\n",
      "(Source: https://bit.ly/3Ovuvdy)\n",
      "It is still unclear whether power-law scaling is a universal property of transf o rmer language models. And given the cost constraint, it’s extremely desirable to have an estimate of the model’s performance in advance. Presently, scaling laws are used as a tool to extrapolate large, expensive models without explicitly training them. However, scaling isn‚Äôt as simple as it sounds. Let‚Äôs take a look at some of the challenges with scaling.\n",
      "Challenges with Scaling\n",
      "While scaling up a model sounds easy in theory. It poses numerous challenges in practice. Following are some of the most significant challenges one is likely to encounter when scaling language models:\n",
      "1. Bias: Scaling can escalate problems related to model bias and toxicity, which often emerges from the training data used to train the models. Large language models can reinforce prejudices and potentially impact individuals and communities disproportionately. Moreover, these models can produce false/misleading information or outright disinformation.\n",
      "2. Infrastructure: Provisioning and managing infrastructure that potentially spans hundreds or thousands of nodes with as many GPUs are not for the faint-hearted. Are the required number of nodes available? Is communication between nodes a bottleneck? Tackling these issues requires a very different skill set than that found in most data science teams. It typically involves specialized engineers who run large-scale, distributed experiments.\n",
      "3. Dataset Curation: A model is only as good as the data it is trained on. Large models are data hungry. When dealing with terabytes of text data, ensuring that the dataset contains high-quality, the bias-free text becomes supremely challenging. Furthermore, even the processing becomes difficult. Another challenge is licensing the training data and personal information.\n",
      "4. Training Cost: Most companies can’t afford the teams and resources required to train models at the largest scales. Given the cost constraint, estimating the model’s performance in advance is extremely desirable.\n",
      "5. Model Evaluation: Evaluating the model on downstream tasks requires time and resources. Additionally, the model needs to be probed for biased and toxic generations. These steps take time and must be carried out thoroughly to mitigate the risks of adverse effects later.\n",
      "6. Reproducibility:¬† AI already had a reproducibility problem. Researchers often publish benchmark results instead of source code, which becomes problematic when the thoroughness of the benchmarks is questioned. But the massive computing required to evaluate large language models exacerbates the problem.\n",
      "7. Explainability: We have often seen researchers claim that ‚Äònew numbers of parameters in our system yielded this new performance on this benchmark,‚Äô but it‚Äôs tough to explain exactly why the system achieves this!\n",
      "8. Benchmarking: Even with enough compute resources, benchmarking large language models is tedious. Some experts contend that popular benchmarks poorly estimate real-world performance and fail to account for the broader ethical, technical, and societal implications. For example, one recent study found that 60% to 70% of answers given by natural language processing models were encoded in the benchmark training sets, indicating that the models were just memorizing answers. Considering this, ways of measuring the performance of these systems need to be expanded ‚Ä¶ When the benchmarks are changed a little bit, they often don‚Äôt generalize well.\n",
      "9. Deployment: ¬†Serving large language models is a major challenge. Although techniques like distillation, pruning, and quantization help in this regard. However, these techniques might not be viable for a model that is 100s of GBs in size. Hosting services such as the OpenAI API or Hugging Face‚Äôs Accelerated Inference API assist companies that cannot or do not want to deal with these deployment challenges.\n",
      "10. Fixing a mistake is a costly affair: The cost of training makes the retraining infeasible. Even OpenAI, which receives massive funding from Microsoft, struggles with this and preferred not to fix the mistake when GPT-3 was implemented. Most companies cannot afford the teams and resources necessary to train/retrain models at the largest scales. Training a single GPT-3-sized model can cost several million dollars, which is not the kind of money companies have.\n",
      "Constraints Foster Creativity\n",
      "Resource constraints can lead to novel solutions with implications beyond the problem they were originally designed to solve. For example, DeepMind published a research paper for a language model called RETRO , which claims to outperform other models 25 times its size by using external memory techniques.\n",
      "Conclusion\n",
      "Leveraging human knowledge of the domain can offer quick gains in the short term. However, leveraging the computation can outperform the former in the long run. The human-knowledge approach often complicates methods, making them less suited to taking advantage of general methods leveraging computation. Scaling laws are employed to extrapolate large, expensive models without explicitly training them. Scaling laws allow empirically quantifying the ‚Äúbigger is better‚Äù paradigm for language models by studying their behavior with varying compute budgets, dataset size, and model size.\n",
      "To sum it up, in this post, we learned about:\n",
      "1. The potential drawbacks of embedding human knowledge of the domain directly into the models than leveraging the computation.\n",
      "2. Importance of Scaling the Transformer models.\n",

      "The webpage discusses the challenges in scaling transformer models, focusing on the drawbacks of embedding human knowledge directly into the models, the importance of scaling, scaling laws, and the challenges associated with scaling the models. It highlights the potential drawbacks of relying on human knowledge over computation, the necessity of scaling transformer models, the empirical evidence supporting large language models, and the challenges such as bias, infrastructure, dataset curation, training cost, model evaluation, reproducibility, explainability, benchmarking, deployment, and the cost of fixing mistakes in large models. The article concludes by emphasizing that resource constraints can lead to novel solutions and creativity in problem-solving.\u001b[00m\n",
