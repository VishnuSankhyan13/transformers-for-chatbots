## Researcher Notes

These files contain technically detailed explanations of how Transformers work, based on the foundational "Attention is All You Need" paper.

- **architecture.md**  
  Breakdown of the Transformer encoder and decoder stacks, multi-head self-attention, feed-forward networks, residual connections, and layer normalization.

- **attention_mechanism.md**  
  Step-by-step overview of query, key, and value vectors; dot-product attention; softmax weights; and the formation of context vectors.

- **transformer_vs_rnn.md**  
  Highlights how Transformers outperform RNNs in parallelism, training speed, and capturing long-range dependencies.

## Journalist Notes

These files summarize the broader implications, emerging innovations, and challenges of Transformers in laymanâ€™s terms.

- **lora_finetuning.md**  
  Introduction to Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), an efficient method for fine-tuning large language models with fewer trainable parameters.

- **multimodal_transformers.md**  
  Future developments in applying Transformers to images, audio, and video inputs using localized attention mechanisms.

- **scaling_challenges.md**  
  Discussion on biases, infrastructure costs, reproducibility issues, explainability, and deployment hurdles in large-scale transformer models.
