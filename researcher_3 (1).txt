In transformer models, the attention mechanism works by allowing the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence when processing each position. This mechanism involves three key components:

1. Query, Key, and Value Vectors: Each input position is associated with three vectors - query, key, and value. These vectors are linear transformations of the input embeddings.

2. Attention Scores: The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query vector of a position with the key vectors of all positions in the sequence. These scores determine how much focus each position should give to the current position during the computation.

3. Attention Weights and Context Vectors: The attention scores are scaled and normalized using a softmax function to obtain attention weights. These weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value vectors, producing a context vector that encapsulates information from relevant positions in the sequence.

By processing the input sequence in this manner, the transformer model can capture long-range dependencies and relationships between different parts of the sequence without relying on sequential processing like RNNs or convolutions.
